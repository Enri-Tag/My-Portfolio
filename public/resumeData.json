    "bio": "Hi guys, my name is Enrico Romano I'm a junior Full-Stack Web Developer, the passion for programming is transmitted to me by my father who is also a programmer. I start by attending a technical computer school, and about three years ago I was struck by a website with animations that greatly caught my attention, From there I started studying web development and today I am finally able to create sites with the same animations that struck me that day.",
